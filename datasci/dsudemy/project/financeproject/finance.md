# Finance Data Project

We need to get data using pandas datareader. The first step is to grab the stock info for the following banks:

-     Bank of America
-     CitiGroup
-     Goldman Sachs
-     JPMorgan Chase
-     Morgan Stanley
-     Wells Fargo


Our next goal is to grab the stock data from **Jan 1st 2006** to **Jan 1st 2016** for each of these banks. To do this, we can set each bank to be a seperate dataframe, with the variable name for that bank being its ticker symbol. To create a ticker symbol, we need to:

1. Use datetime to set start and end datetime objects.
2. Figure out the ticker symbol for each bank.
3. Figure out how to use datareader to grab info on the stock.
